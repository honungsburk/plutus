/**
 * A Hybrid Logical Clock (HLC) to track the order of events in a distributed
 * system.
 *
 * @remark Not thread safe. (does not matter in browsers!)
 *
 * @remark Assumptions
 * 1. Your node uses NTP Sync.
 * 2. Clocks are monotonicly increasing
 *
 * @remark Properties
 * 1. Monotonically increasing
 * 2. if hl1.equals(hl2) then we have no idea about the order of events
 * 3. if event `e` is before event `f` for node `p` (`p.e < p.f`)
 * and event `f` is before event `i` on node `l` (`l.f < l.i`) then
 * when the nodes are synced `p.f < p.i` is guaranteed.
 *
 *
 * @example
 * Instantiate a singelton in your system like so:
 * ```ts
 * const Clock = new HybridLogicalClock(() => new Date())
 *
 * ```
 * @remark There is no need to persist the HLC between sessions. The `hlc.now()` call will
 * always update to the current timestamp anyway.
 *
 * @remark It can not tell you when something happened since the system clock in a node
 * could be incorrect. But can be used to order events as they are received at a node.
 *
 * @remark Based on the implmentation by [Martic Fowler]{@link https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/hybrid-clock.html}
